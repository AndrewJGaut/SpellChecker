1. Find a free dictionary
2. download and read dictionary in
3. download and read in a full book (already have gatsby)
	-use this to find context of words, likelihood one word follows another
4. store data in a hashtable
5. order of Markov chain (how many words past you want to store)



STILL TO DO:
- write probability function
- write context checker? 
	Markov chain?
- implement probabilistic analysis
- write class which incorporates that analysis
- make it so the vector is sorted by proability
- FIX FIND WORDS FUNCTION
